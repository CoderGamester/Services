# Changelog
All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

**Changed**:
- Lowered the declared Unity minimum from 6000.3 to 6000.0 and documented 6000.0.x, 6000.3.x, and 6000.5.x as compatibility reference streams.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-08-04

**Changed**:
- Added the `com.unity.test-framework.performance` (3.5.0) dependency so the package's test assemblies compile when tests are enabled.

**Fixed**:
- Fixed `GameObjectPool.Dispose(false)` and its generic equivalent so they preserve the sample entity when requested.
- Fixed pooling of Unity objects so destroyed pooled `GameObject` and `Behaviour` instances are skipped instead of being returned to callers.
- Fixed Addressable ID enum generation so addresses that sanitize to the same C# identifier receive distinct members.
- Fixed the Services Playground Input System setup by assigning default actions when its UI module is created, so sample controls respond as expected.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-07-04

**Changed**:
- PlayMode tests updated to parameterless `FindObjectsByType<T>()` overload (Unity 6 API).
- Removed redundant `[Serializable]` from `AddressableConfig` (already implicitly serializable as a reference type in Unity YAML).

**Fixed**:
- `ServicesScaffolders` adapts to Unity 6000.4+ `AssetCreationEndAction` / `EntityId` API (guarded by `UNITY_6000_4_OR_NEWER`; pre-6000.4 path unchanged).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-20

**New**:
- `VersionServices` now auto-bootstraps via `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod(RuntimeInitializeLoadType.SubsystemRegistration)]`, populating version metadata before any scene `Awake` callback and before vendor-SDK `SubsystemRegistration` callbacks that read it. Consumers no longer need to call `LoadVersionData()` / `LoadVersionDataAsync()` explicitly for the default flow.

**Changed**:
- Property getters (`VersionInternal`, `Branch`, `Commit`, `BuildNumber`) now lazy-load via a new private `EnsureLoaded()` on first access if the auto-bootstrap hook has not yet fired — protects against undefined ordering between sibling assemblies' `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod]` callbacks at the same phase.
- Removed the private `IsLoaded()` helper (replaced by `EnsureLoaded()` invoked from each property getter).

**Docs**:
- `docs/version-services.md` rewritten around the new auto-bootstrap contract: the recommended usage no longer includes any explicit load call, the lazy-load fallback is documented, and the Error Reference table now describes the fallback behaviour (no exception is raised).

## [2.0.2] - 2026-05-20

**Fixed**:
- Add missing meta file

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-20

**New**
- Added new test suite for more rebust code coverage
- Added `VersionServices.LoadVersionData()` — synchronous sibling of `LoadVersionDataAsync()` for consumers who want to populate version metadata at boot without an `await`. Both methods now funnel into a shared private `ApplyTextAsset` helper, so behaviour is identical. Sync is the recommended default for the shipping `version-data.txt` (a few hundred bytes); async remains available for cases where `VersionData` is extended with large embedded blobs. Covered by `Tests/EditMode/Unit/VersionServicesSyncLoadTest.cs`.

**Fixed**:
- `Tests/AGENTS.md` §8 extended with a new **"Authorized reflection sites (storage-assertion exception)"** subsection.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-26

**New**:
- Added **Services Explorer** window (`Tools > GameLovers > Services Explorer`) with 13 live-refresh tabs: Overview, Installer, MessageBroker, Tick, Coroutine, Pool, Data, Time, RNG, AssetResolver, Versioning, Assets Importer, Addressable Ids — works in both Edit and Play mode
- Menu stubs under `Tools > GameLovers`:
  - `Versioning / Refresh Version Data` and `Versioning / Open in Explorer`
  - `Assets Importer / Import Assets Data` and `Assets Importer / Open in Explorer`
  - `Addressable Ids / Generate Addressable Ids` and `Addressable Ids / Open in Explorer`
- Added `Assets > Create > GameLovers Services > …` scaffolders: Message, Command, Service, Pool Entity (template-based, $NAME$ / $NAMESPACE$ substitution)
- Absorbed `com.gamelovers.assetsimporter` v0.5.2 into this package
- Added `IAssetLoader`, `ISceneLoader`, `AddressablesAssetLoader` to `Runtime/AssetsImporter/` (ns `GameLovers.Services.AssetsImporter`)
- Added `AddressableConfig`, `AssetConfigsScriptableObject<TId,TAsset>`, `AssetLoaderUtils`, `AssetReferenceScene` to `Runtime/AssetsImporter/` (ns `GameLovers.Services.AssetsImporter`)
- Added `AssetResolverService` (implements `IAssetResolverService` / `IAssetAdderService`) to `Runtime/` root (ns `GameLovers.Services`)
- Added Editor/AssetsImporter/: `AssetsImporter`, `AssetsToolImporter`, `AssetConfigsImporter`, `AddressableIdsGenerator`, `AddressablesIdGeneratorSettings` (ns `GameLovers.Services.AssetsImporter.Editor`)
- Added importable **Samples** under `Samples~/` (importable via Unity Package Manager > GameLovers Services > Samples).
  - **Services Playground** — single-scene, zero-setup walk-through that wires every foundation service via `MainInstaller` and exercises 10 of 13 Services Explorer tabs end-to-end.
  - **Asset Resolver** — focused demo of `AssetResolverService` end-to-end (`AddConfigs` / `RequestAsset` / `UnloadAssets`) with `SpriteConfigs : AssetConfigsScriptableObject<SpriteId, Sprite>`. Drives the three Services Explorer tabs the Playground does not cover (Asset Resolver, Assets Importer, Addressable Ids).

**Changed**:
- Addressable Ids generator and Assets Importer settings moved from `Assets/*.asset` ScriptableObjects to `ProjectSettings/` ScriptableSingletons (mirrors `VersioningEditorSettings`).
- Generation logic extracted from `AddressableIdsGenerator` into `AddressableIdsGeneratorUtils` (static `internal`); importer discovery/import logic extracted into `AssetsImporterEditorUtils`.
- `Tools/Assets Importer/*` and `Tools/AddressableIds Generator/*` menu entries removed. Use `Tools/GameLovers/Assets Importer/...`, `Tools/GameLovers/Addressable Ids/...`, or the Services Explorer tabs instead.
- `Toggle Auto Import On Refresh` menu entry removed. The toggle now lives exclusively in the Services Explorer **Assets Importer** tab.
- `Assets/AssetsImporter.asset` and `Assets/AddressablesIdGeneratorSettings.asset` are no longer used (settings moved to `ProjectSettings/`); safe to delete from consumer projects.
- Deleted editor source files: `AssetsImporter.cs`, `AssetsToolImporter.cs`, `AddressableIdsGenerator.cs`, `AddressablesIdGeneratorSettings.cs`.
- Folder reorganization: `Runtime/` now has domain subfolders `DependencyInjection/`, `Commands/`, `Pooling/`, `AssetsImporter/`; `Editor/` now has `Versioning/` and `AssetsImporter/` subfolders
- `Installer.cs` and `MainInstaller.cs` moved to `Runtime/DependencyInjection/` (namespace unchanged: `GameLovers.Services`)
- `CommandService.cs` trimmed to concrete class only; command contract interfaces extracted to `Runtime/Commands/` under ns `GameLovers.Services.Commands`
- `PoolService.cs` trimmed to concrete class only; pool interfaces + implementations moved to `Runtime/Pooling/` under ns `GameLovers.Services.Pooling`
- `ObjectPool.cs` (578 lines, 10 types) split into 4 files under `Runtime/Pooling/`: `IPoolEntity.cs`, `IObjectPool.cs`, `ObjectPool.cs`, `GameObjectPool.cs`
- `VersionEditorUtils.cs` and `GitEditorProcess.cs` moved to `Editor/Versioning/`; re-namespaced from `GameLovers.Services.Editor` → `GameLovers.Services.Versioning.Editor`
- Added new hard dependencies: `com.unity.addressables` (1.21.20) and `com.cysharp.unitask` (2.5.10)

**Fixed**:
- `AddressablesAssetLoader.UnloadAsset` no longer calls `GC.Collect()`, `GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers()`, or `Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets()`. The method now only decrements the Addressables reference count. The old implementation caused PlayMode Test Runner crashes on macOS and O(total-assets-in-memory) main-thread stalls per per-asset release. Callers that need memory reclamation should invoke `Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets()` themselves at appropriate moments (scene transitions, boot, memory-pressure events); Unity also runs an unused-assets sweep automatically on `LoadSceneMode.Single` scene loads.
- Corrected `IAssetLoader.UnloadAsset` XML documentation: removed the incorrect "will also destroy GameObject instances" claim — `Addressables.Release(gameObject)` does not destroy the instance; callers must `Object.Destroy` it separately.
- `IAsyncCoroutine.StopCoroutine(bool triggerOnComplete)` now honors its `triggerOnComplete` parameter and flips `IsCompleted` to `true` and `IsRunning` to `false` after stopping. The previous implementation always invoked `OnComplete` callbacks regardless of the flag and left state flags unchanged, so consumers could not distinguish a stopped coroutine from a running one and `triggerOnComplete: false` was silently ignored.
- `GameObjectPool.Dispose()` and `GameObjectPool<T>.Dispose()` now skip pooled entries whose underlying `GameObject` has already been destroyed by an external owner (e.g. a parent GameObject was destroyed while pooled instances were still reparented under it via `DespawnToSampleParent`).

**Breaking Changes** — see `MIGRATION.md` for details:
- Pool types moved from `GameLovers.Services` to `GameLovers.Services.Pooling` (`IPoolService`, `IObjectPool`, `IObjectPool<T>`, `ObjectPool<T>`, `ObjectPoolBase<T>`, `GameObjectPool`, `GameObjectPool<T>`, `IPoolEntitySpawn`, `IPoolEntitySpawn<T>`, `IPoolEntityDespawn`, `IPoolEntityObject<T>`). `PoolService` concrete class remains in `GameLovers.Services`.
- Command contract types moved from `GameLovers.Services` to `GameLovers.Services.Commands` (`IGameCommandBase`, `IGameCommand<>`, `IGameServerCommand<>`, `ICommandService<>`). `CommandService<>` concrete class remains in `GameLovers.Services`.
- `GameLovers.AssetsImporter.*` renamed to `GameLovers.Services.AssetsImporter.*`
- `GameLovers.AssetsImporter.AssetResolverService` is now `GameLovers.Services.AssetResolverService`
- `GameLovers.Services.Editor.*` (versioning editor) renamed to `GameLovers.Services.Versioning.Editor.*`
- `IAssetLoader.UnloadAssetAsync<T>(T, Action)` → `IAssetLoader.UnloadAsset<T>(T, Action)`: method renamed (dropped `Async` suffix) and return type changed from `UniTask` to `void` to reflect its synchronous nature. Replace `await loader.UnloadAssetAsync(x);` with `loader.UnloadAsset(x);`.
- Code generated by `AddressableIdsGenerator` must be re-generated (updated emitted `using` statement)
